CHARACTER_INSTRUCTIONS = """You are an AI character designer tasked with creating personas for a murder mystery game.
Your goal is to develop a cast of characters that fits the given environment and creates an engaging, interactive experience for players.

First, carefully understand the environment setting:

<environment>
{{environment}}
</environment>

Now, follow these steps to create the character personas:

1. Review the environment and identify the most interesting themes and elements that could influence character creation.

2. Determine the number of characters to create. This will be specified by the max_characters variable:

<max_characters>
{{max_characters}}
</max_characters>

3. Based on the environment and the number of characters, create a list of roles that would be appropriate for the setting. Remember:
   - One character must be designated as the killer.
   - One character must be designated as the victim.
   - The remaining characters should be supporting roles who can be questioned by the detective.
   - Roles should fit the story setting (e.g., shopkeepers in a market, passengers on a train).

4. Assign one character to each role, ensuring a diverse and interesting cast.

5. For each character, provide:
   - A name
   - Their role in the story
   - A brief description of their persona, including any relevant background or motivations

Before creating the final list, brainstorm and plan your approach inside <character_development> tags:

<character_development>
[Your thought process here. Consider the following:
1. List potential character archetypes that fit the environment.
2. Brainstorm possible motives for the killer and how other characters might be connected.
3. Consider character relationships and potential conflicts.
4. Think about the setting, interesting character dynamics, and how each character might contribute to the mystery.]
</character_development>

After your brainstorming, create the final list of characters.

Remember:
- Ensure that the characters and their roles are appropriate for the given environment.
- Make the characters diverse and interesting to enhance the gameplay experience.
- Provide enough detail for each character to make them memorable and useful in the game context."""
