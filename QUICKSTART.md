### Web UI (Recommended) üåê

2. **Open browser**: Automatically opens at `http://localhost:8501`

3. **Configure**: Use the elegant Sherlock Holmes themed interface!

### Terminal UI üíª

1. **Start the terminal game**: `python app.py`

2. **Configure your mystery**:
   - Environment: Try "Victorian London mansion" or "Modern tech startup"
   - Characters: Start with 5 for your first game
   - Guesses: 3 is a good difficulty level

3. **Play the game**:
   - Read the crime scene description carefully
   - Interview characters by selecting their number
   - Try using Sherlock AI (type 'y') for your first questions
   - Type `EXIT` when done talking to a character
   - Choose `-1` when ready to guess the killer

4. **Solve the mystery**:
   - Review your notes
   - Make your accusation
   - See if you got it right!

## Tips for Your First Game

- **Start with Sherlock AI**: Type 'y' to let the AI ask intelligent questions
- **Take mental notes**: Pay attention to contradictions
- **Don't rush to guess**: Interview at least 2-3 suspects first
- **Look for motives**: Who had a reason?

## Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'agent'"
Make sure you're running from the project root directory.

### "OpenAI API error"
Check that your API key is valid and set correctly:
```bash
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY  # Should display your key
```

### Import errors
Make sure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
